# Sahne Dünya Packet Liders
Sahne Dünya Packet Liders is the standard system package manager for the Sahne Karnal architecture developed by Sahne Dünya. This package manager is written in the Rust programming language. Package managers are vital to operating systems. Without them, software installation would have to be manual. Automatic installation requires a package manager, not just for the operating system but for some applications as well. The project also includes libraries used for the package manager, but this isn't an existing library; it was created from scratch. The system calls come from Sahne64. Frankly, it's a low-level package manager!
